# Scripting Languages

Some computer languages are classified as scripting languages and were written as high-level languages to connect underlying software components. They were specifically written to be easy to use. Many were intended for System Automation; an early example was IBMâ€™s Job Control Language (JCL) which was intended to orchestrate batch processing. Most users will be familiar with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), used as a basis for automation applications in Microsoft Office. Python is often classified as a scripting language.&#x20;

As they are scriptable, many authors consider the MS-DOS. PowerShell and Unix shells to be scripting languages.
