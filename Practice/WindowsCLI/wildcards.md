# Wildcards

When searching for files (or copying or removing) it can be very handy to use wildcards.

The (\*) symbol (pronounced splat) is probably the most common.&#x20;

For example in DOS, **dir \*.txt** would return all text files&#x20;

Because of extensions, wildcards behave a bit differently between DOS and Unix.&#x20;

## DOS

The command **dir **_**.com**_ shows all files ending in **.com**, these are small programs.&#x20;

The command **dir R.txt** shows all files beginning with **R** or **r** and with an extension **.txt**

**\*.\*** means all files in the working directory&#x20;

## Exercise

Delete all files in the **CLI/Backup** directory, then copy all files from **CLI** directory to **CLI/Backup** directory, using wildcards.
