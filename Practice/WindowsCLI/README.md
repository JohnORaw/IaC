# Introduction

I first started working with computer equipment back in the 1970s. My school got an Apple II, one of my neighbors got a Commodore VIC20 (look them up) and I got a book on programming from a friend. A few years later, I got to work on some of the early business computers, the first MAC and the most early business computers running an operating system called CPM. To operate these computers, with one or two floppy disk drives, required the ability to learn a disk operating system (DOS). It may sound bizarre, but the commands and approaches learned back then, are almost exactly the same as we use at the command prompt in a modern Windows computer.&#x20;

As I worked with larger computers in the 1980s, I began to work with the Unix command shell. Once again, nothing much has changed in the intervening years!

Before launching into more modern paradigms, we need to begin with the basic command prompt instructions.

In this document, there are several key terms. These will be _italicized_. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them. Commands are generally shown in **bold**.

In these notes:

I will assume your Windows home directory is&#x20;

**C:\Users\\**_**username**_**\OneDrive - Atlantic TU\IaC\Week1**

If you have a different path, adapt!
