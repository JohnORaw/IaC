# Making, Deleting and Changing Directories

To keep our files organised, we need to be able to make and delete directories. We also need to be able to change working directory as required. Note that commands in Unix and DOS are similar but not the same. In either operating system, the **tree** command gives a nice overview of the directory tree structure from the working directory down.&#x20;

## DOS

The command **cd **_**directoryname**_ changes the working directory.&#x20;

The command **md **_**subdirectory**_ makes a new directory.

The command **rm **_**subdirectory**_ removes a sub directory.

## Exercise

Go to you home directory.&#x20;

1. Create a directory called **CLI**
2. Change your working directory to **CLI**
3. Create a directory called **Backup** under the directory **CLI**
4. Create a directory called **Test** under the directory **CLI**
5. Return to your home directory by typing **cd**. You will often see **cd\~** used, it has the same effect.
6. Use the **tree** command to review what you have done.
7. Delete the directory called **Test**, you may have to navigate to it!&#x20;
8. Check the result of the command **cd ..**
9. In either operating system, **cd /** should bring you back to the root.
