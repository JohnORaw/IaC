# Copying, Moving and Deleting Files

Make sure you are in the directory called **CLI**.&#x20;

The format of the copy command is **copy **_**source destination**_&#x20;

This will copy from an existing file (_source_) to a new file (_destination_) leaving the original file where it was.&#x20;

To move a file in DOS, the format of the command is **move **_**source destination**_&#x20;

This will move an existing file (_source_) to a new location (_destination_), removing the original file.

To delete a file in DOS, the format of the command is **del **_**filename**_&#x20;

This will delete a file (_filename_)&#x20;
