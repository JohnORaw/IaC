# Create a file from the console

There are several ways of creating a plain old text file from the command prompt. We will use a few techniques here primarily for the exercise value!&#x20;

In either OS, make sure you are in the directory called CLI. We are going to create a file with the lines (you need to get this exactly right!!):&#x20;

_Living easy, living free._&#x20;

_Season ticket on a one-way ride._&#x20;

_Asking nothing, leave me be._&#x20;

_Taking everything in my stride._

To create a file called _rubbish.txt_ type **copy con rubbish.txt**&#x20;

The **copy** command works as **copy **_**source destination**_. In this case the source is the console where you are typing.

You will get a blank line awaiting some input. Type the lines of the sample file and then to save the file, press **\<ctrl>\<z>** when you are finished.&#x20;

Create these files. In either operating system, type **more rubbish.txt** to display the contents of the file.
