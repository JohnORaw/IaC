This document will demonstrate commands at the DOS command prompt. You will be required to keep a list of commands with notes as to why you are using them as well as results of any testing you have done. You may be asked to present these notes as evidence of work completed or as part of a lab book, or a cheat sheet.&#x20;

You must submit this to GITHUB later in the couse as proof of work done.

Check with your lecturer!
