This document will demonstrate commands at the DOS and UNIX command prompts. You will be required to keep a list of commands with notes as to why you are using them as well as results of any testing you have done. You may be asked to present these notes as evidence of work completed or as part of a lab book, or a cheat sheet. Check with your lecturer!
