# Working Environment

Be careful, but you can carry these exercises out on almost any computer, safely. You may be deleting files and directories, hence the warning!

If you are familiar with VMWare Workstation or Hyper-V, you can stand up some VMs to carry out this work, this is always the preferred approach.

I have no idea what environment you are going to be doing these exercises in.&#x20;

If you're in a university laboratory, you may have a cloud share assigned to

**C:\Users\\**_**username**_**\OneDrive - Atlantic TU\IaC\Week1**

On a home computer, your home directory will be **c:\users\\**_**username**_**\IaC\Week1**&#x20;

Throughout these notes, adapt my instructions to wherever your home directory actually is.
