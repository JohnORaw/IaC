# Extensions

Files often have a dot in their name, this has a different significance in Windows or Unix.

Filenames have a dot and this is of a structural nature. It was used in the original DOS to identify file types; the bit after the dot had to be three letters long and was called the extension. For example:&#x20;

* .com is a small programme
* .exe is a large programme
* .doc or docx was a typical word document
* .xls or .xlsx was a spreadsheet
* .txt a text file
* **.bat** is a special kind of file with a list of shell instructions, more recently also **.cmd**&#x20;
