# Additional Software

From Windows using Linux, we typically use a terminal like Putty and a file copy program like WinSCP. We could bypass all this in WSL2, but I want you to use these features from a teaching perspective.

I download the 64-bit version of Putty [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/\~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

I download WinSCP from [here](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), careful there are advertising links on this page.
