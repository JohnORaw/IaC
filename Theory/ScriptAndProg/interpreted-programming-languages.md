# Interpreted Programming Languages

We could argue semantics, but Basic, Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript called all be classified as interpreted languages. An interpreter is a program which takes source code in a high-level language, and translates it into executable code at runtime. In most cases, this means small programs are easy and quick to write, but are not fast.

## LISP

My least favorite programming language of all time is LISP. The language was written in the 1950s based on theoretical concepts as to how we might approach artificial intellegence \[1]. It focused on list processing and used the concept of recursion. After a month coding in it, I gave up programming for a while!&#x20;

## Basic

In the early days of distributed computing, IBM establish their PC project. They needed to include a programming language, and they used BASIC. This was an interpreted language; you ran a programme called basic and wrote your code. The interpreter compiled and ran the code at runtime. From a performance perspective, the is non-optimal. For ease of use, this is an excellent way of creating simple programs.

Basic evolved into GWBasic, then Visual Basic. Then Windows came along and the original language all but disappeared. However, the Windows version of Visual Basic still exists.
