# Introduction

## Introduction

These notes are intended to introduce some fundamentals before a student commences a module in scripting, or Infrastructure as Code (IaC). These notes are a basic introduction and are intended to let us share a basis of terminology and understanding. Many of the topics I will cover require a rigorous, theoretical treatment to understand properly. That is not what is intended here!&#x20;

In this document, there are several key terms. These will be _italicized_. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them. Commands are generally shown in **bold**. Where I use powers, I show then using the caret symbol, e.g. 2^4 = 16.
