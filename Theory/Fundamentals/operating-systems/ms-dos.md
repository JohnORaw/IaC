# MS-DOS

For completeness, I will mention MS-DOS here. A range of early operating systems were developed for the 8086 processor and the remains of MS-DOS are still with us as the **cmd** terminal. Microsoft have tried to deprecate this, but many systems still require some access at the old command prompt.

In practical exercises, I still get students to do work at this command prompt and to write scripts or batch files.
