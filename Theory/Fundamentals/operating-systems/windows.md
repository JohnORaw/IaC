# Windows

Early Windows was just a graphical user interface on top of DOS technology. To be honest, this didn't improve much until Microsoft introduced Windows NT, where the NT may mean "New Technology". Feel free to read the conspiracy theories regarding the alternative explanations for the name.

From c. 2006, Microsoft have used Power Shell as a way to automate Windows and we will look at Power Shell as a scripting language later in the course.
